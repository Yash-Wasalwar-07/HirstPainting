Dot painting using Python Turtle

ðŸŽ¨Damien Hirst has been focussing on developing his passion for colour in the iconic Spot Paintings series since 1986. 
These paintings and prints are created from lines of coloured spots that repeat the same pattern: 
spots of every different shade are mathematically aligned, their diameter equal to the distance between each spot. 
Resembling candy sweets, round as a pill, the repetitive motif can prove disturbing; a feeling enhanced by the scientific titles.

So one of his art named Flumequine Art which is a spot painting art, can be created using Python Turtle Module
The art looks something like this -
